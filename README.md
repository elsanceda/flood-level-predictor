# Flood Level Predictor
This is a course requirement for the CS180 Artificial Intelligence Course of the Department of Computer Science, College of Engineering, University of the Philippines, Diliman under the guidance of Carlo Raquel for AY 2022-2023.

This is a Multilayer Perceptron model trained to predict the flood level in Metro Manila given the latitude, longitude, elevation, and precipitation rate. The flood level is predicted as one of the following categories defined in the dataset:

* 0 - No flood
* 1 - Ankle High
* 2 - Knee High
* 3 - Waist High
* 4 - Neck High
* 5 - Top of Head High
* 6 - 1-storey High
* 7 - 1.5-storey High
* 8 - 2-storeys or Higher

The dataset used to train the model was the [Metro Manila Flood Landscape Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giologicx/aegisdataset) uploaded by GiologicX on Kaggle.
